# mathHelper

This is a mathHelper, although the goal is for it to be more than that, and it would be more accurate to call it a chemHelper (but chemSolver is already taken). I plan on using it to create my first large-ish project. I intend for it to do the following:
- Percent composition of a chemical formula
- Balance an unbalanced chemical reaction
- Solve a limiting reactant problem given initial conditions, and report mass of each product.

I also would like to implement:
- Linear algebra tools such as
    - reduction to row echelon
    - reduction to reduced echelon form
    - calculation of transformations and determinants
- Expression solver (I think this may be the most work)

And finally, I would like to eventually integrate OpenGL or Qt to make it a graphical interface. The goal is for this project to be at least semi-working for the spring semester to use in SWENG431 "Verification, Validation and Testing".

I hope you enjoy!
